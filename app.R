# RStudio's "Run App" button launches this file in a separate R process that
# inherits RSTUDIO=1 from the parent session but isn't connected to the
# RStudio API. cli (used by pkgload) sees RSTUDIO=1 and tries to query the
# RStudio theme via rstudioapi, which throws "RStudio not running" because
# that connection doesn't actually exist here. Clearing the var makes cli
# skip that probe. Harmless for Ctrl+Enter, sourcing, or shinyapps.io, where
# RSTUDIO isn't set (or the mismatch doesn't occur) anyway.
